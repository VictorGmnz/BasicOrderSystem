<Strong>As the name already said, this code is a simple system to create and management client order that can be made in some store or market.</br>
Need to improve sometings, like adding the database to separate the product and clients informations of a new order; today them are doing the same thing together. But this isn't the ideal, because usually the customer need to already know the price to buy a product, and of course, it's not a fluid process the employee needing to putting the product price ever order he gonna do.</br>
Need also to improve the options to remove an item for the order, or even empty it, and probably also need to add other managements options of an order.</br>
